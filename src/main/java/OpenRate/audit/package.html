    The "audit" infrastructure tracks the CVS version numbers of each of the main
    modules in the current framework. This allows the easy identification of
    software versions from the log file. This is especially useful for 
    understanding how problems occurred and if they have been fixed. The
    version tracking is fully automated. OpenRate traverses the module stack
    and includes the version number of each module it finds in the Framework log.
    
    If a module is found without audit information, a warning is displayed.
    You can optionally configure only core module logging in order to turn this
    warning message off in the OpenRate framework configuration. This is useful
    if you do not use CVS for your own application development.
